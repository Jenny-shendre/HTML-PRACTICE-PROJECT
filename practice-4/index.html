<h2>
    Java Refactoring Approaches
</h2>
<p>
    Refactoring in Java has many aspects, but among all of them, there are two fundamentals:
    object-oriented and
<p>
    functional. Object-oriented existed almost from the first Java version, whereas functional
    appeared only with
</p>

<p>
    Java 1.8 (March 2014).
</p>
</p>
<h2>

    Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional Approaches
</h2>
<p>
    Java is a classical object-oriented language and allows the creation of flexible object structures. After Java
    1.8
<p>received functional features, it became capable to operate not only with objects or methods but with lambdas

<p>
    (which is executable code itself). In the functional world, you can operate with functions as with objects in
    the
</p>
OO world.
</p>
</p>

<h2>
    Refactoring Code Using OO Approach
</h2>
<p>
    Playing with interfaces and classes using inheritance or composition, you can create reusable generic solutions
<P>
    that can reduce the code amount and increase readability. Classes can be united in the same common structure
</P>
<p>
    if
    they:
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>

        Have similar fields and recognized as the same entity
    </li>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li>

        Have relations parent/children

    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Have similar purpose methods

    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Refactoring Code Using Functional Approach
</h2>
<p>
    Unlike the OO approach, this one extracts the code that has the same behavior. For example, we can recognize
<p>
    similarities in the next examples:
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Implementation has the same return type
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Implementation has the same functionality
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Refactoring Example Using Both Approaches
</h1>
<p>
    Let's assume we have a small application that makes payments to permanent and contract employees.
<P>
    fter each
    payment, we print a report about Employee and show the in data different formats (JSON and XML for
</P>
<P>
    A permanent and
    contractor).
</P>
</p>
<img src="1651502570803.png" alt="image2" width="800">
<p>
    Now let's take a look at the default structure:
</p>
<img src="1651521066111.png" alt="image3" width="800">
<h2>
    Refactoring Classes Structure
</h2>
<p>
    It is pretty visible that Contractor can be a child of Employee class. makePayment can be overridden
<P>
    (also we might
    create a Payable interface and extract makePayment method, but let's keep it simple). So after
</P>
<P>
    refactoring, we might
    have some fields in common together with reused constructors.
</P>
</p>
<img src="1651505037201.png" alt="image4" width="800">
<h2>
    Refactoring Functional Aspects
</h2>
<p>
    Now we can review and find similarities from a functional perspective:
</p>
<img src="1651511097905.png" alt="image5" width="800">
<p>
    As you can see from the printing report, we process it in the same way: we pass an object and return a string.
<P>
    So we
    can extract that code as a reusable function and use it dynamically for this business logic or even
</P>
<P>
    outside of it.
</P>
</p>
<h2>
    Creating Function Interface
</h2>
<p>
    In order to decide the right functional interface (e.g., Predicate, Consumer, Function, etc.), we need to check our
<P>
    inputs and outputs. In our case, we get an Object and convert it to a String.

</P>

</p>
<img src="1651518443739.png" alt="image6" width="800">
<p>
    Such an interface is provided by function, but in order to make it more clear, we create our own Converter
<P>
    interface
    with method serialize. In that case, it would be easily readable:
</P>
</p>
<img src="1651518567812.png" alt="image7" width="300">
<h2>
    Creating Lambdas: Converter Functional Interface
</h2>
<p>
    Now having a functional interface we create two Converters: json and xml. Both of them will match the
<P>
    defined
    signature (object input and string output).
</P>
</p>
<img src="1651701799850.png" alt="image8" width="800">
<P>
    Now let's use them in our code:
</P>
<img src="1651521656192.png" alt="image9" width="800">
<h2>
    Encapsulating Converters Inside Employee Class
</h2>
<p>
    As in the last step, we can encapsulate this function right inside the parent Employer class and use them inside
<P>
    the
    internal function:
</P>
</p>
<img src="1651522100677.png" alt="image10" width="800">
<h1>
    Reviewing the Final Version
</h1>
<p>
    As in the last step, we initialize both employers and iterate through them executing payment and printing methods.
</p>
<img src="1651524712131.png" alt="image11" width="700">
<p>
    So what do we have at the end?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Commons fields and methods from parent Employer class are now reused in Contractor
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Extracted functions converters can be replenished in the future without changing the Employer class
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Extracted functions can be reused outside of the Employer class
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Criticism
</h1>
<img src="1651527838817.png" alt="imgae12" width="500">
<p>
    The shown example is not perfect and can be improved. For example, we can hide the Employee/Contractors
<P>
    class behind
    the interface, and it's good practice! I tried to write a simple example and decided to show just
</P>
<P>
    some OO and
    Functional features.
</P>
</p>

<p>
    The functions I've created are not pure functions and some developers insist it's much better to have only pure
<P>
    functions in Java. It's a big discussion outside of this article.
</P>
</p>
<h2>
    My Personal Criticism About Functions
</h2>
<p>
    One of the purposes of this article was to make readers more confident with a functional approach;
<P>
    but at the same
    time, I'm a person who prefers methods or static methods over functions. Why? Because the old method
</P>
<P>
    approach allows
    you to read code line by line from top to bottom and you can easily see the logic. With a
</P>
<P>
    functional approach, you
    have to return back (or memorize) the function content when the function is called.
</P>
<P>
    So, as I think about extracting
    the same functionality code into methods/static methods - personally, I think it
</P>
<P>
    might be better.
</P>
</p>
<h2>
    Final Message
</h2>
<img src="1651526848425.png" alt="image13" width="700">
<p>
    The main message of this article is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the object-oriented approach in order to unite similar-by-nature objects in one structure
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use a functional approach to unite similar-by-functionality code. Together they make code significantly more
        readable and maintainable. The code used in this article is available here.
    </li>
</ul>
